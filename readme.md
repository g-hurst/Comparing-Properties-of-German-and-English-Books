### Overview
This project was completed as a use case for the [LexicalRichness](https://github.com/LSYS/LexicalRichness) tool. This project takes seven books listed below in `figure 1` and compares some lexicographical properties between the English and German versions of the text.

| Book Title                        | Author                 | 
| :---                              |    :----:              | 
| A Christmas Carol                 | Charles Dickens        | 
| Alices Adventures in Wonderland   | Lewis Carroll          | 
| Macbeth                           | Shakespeare            |
| Romeo and Juliet                  | Shakespeare            |
| Oliver Twist                      | Charles Dickens        |
| Peter Pan                         | James Barrie           |
| Treasure Island                   | Robert Louis Stevenson |

### Study

This exploration was done to calculate and compare some of the lexicographical properties of text once it has been translated from English to German. Seven unique books were analyzed. <b>The results of this exploration describe the few books that were analyzed, but since the sample size is so small, this can NOT be used to generalize translation of any book from English to German.</b>

#### Measurement of Words and Terms

Before quantifying the lexical diversity in each book, the length of each book was plotted.
