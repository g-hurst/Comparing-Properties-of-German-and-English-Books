## 1 Overview
This project was completed as a use case for the [LexicalRichness](https://github.com/LSYS/LexicalRichness) tool. This project takes seven books listed below in `figure 1` and compares some lexicographical properties between the English and German versions of the text.

| Book Title                        | Author                 | 
| :---                              |    :----:              | 
| A Christmas Carol                 | Charles Dickens        | 
| Alices Adventures in Wonderland   | Lewis Carroll          | 
| Macbeth                           | Shakespeare            |
| Romeo and Juliet                  | Shakespeare            |
| Oliver Twist                      | Charles Dickens        |
| Peter Pan                         | James Barrie           |
| Treasure Island                   | Robert Louis Stevenson |

## 2 Study

This exploration was done to calculate and compare some of the lexicographical properties of text once it has been translated from English to German. Seven unique books were analyzed. <b>The results of this exploration describe the few books that were analyzed, but since the sample size is so small, this can NOT be used to generalize translation of any book from English to German.</b>

### 2.1 Measurement of Words and Terms

The first property of the books explored was the length of the text. This was quantified by getting the total number of words in each book. In addition to this, the number of unique terms in each book was also calculated. The number of words in each book was plotted in Figure 2.1, and the number of terms in each book was plotted in Figure 2.2. In addition to this, the number of words vs number of unique terms for each book was plotted in Figure 2.3. <br>\

Looking at Figure 2.1 and 2.2, it can be seen that the English version of the books have more words on average, but the German translations have more unique terms. Figure 2.3 shows that the number of unique terms tends to increase with the word count in each book, and the number of unique terms in the German translations increases more rapidly than their English originals.
